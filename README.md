# .NET-Design-Patterns
 Popular design patterns implemented with .NET

In the repository you will find some popular design patterns implemented with .NET technologies. The goal is to illustrate with simple examples how we can use these patterns.

##### Abstract Factory

The abstract factory pattern in software engineering is a design pattern that provides a way to create families of related objects without imposing their concrete classes, by encapsulating a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.[1] According to this pattern, a client software component creates a concrete implementation of the abstract factory and then uses the generic interface of the factory to create the concrete objects that are part of the family.

The example is implemented with .NET 8 so be sure that your configuration supports this version of the platform.
